How does the character of Rancho react to the ragging and what can be inferred about his personality?,"['329\nenters the story, preaches, and then leaves. He is too perfect. How did Rancho as \na character evolve and did you have any fears and apprehensions that he might \nappear to be more ﬁ  ction than real as he began to take shape?\nRH: The backbone of Rancho’s character which also separates him from everybody \nelse is his lack of fear. He is a brilliant, free-spirited, and honest boy who is \nchasing what he is interested in most. Probably a person without fear has become \nunfathomable today so Rancho might seem unreal to some but to me he is very \nreal. My ﬁ rst thoughts on Rancho were that he is a boy from a village who has had \nno experience with formal education so he does not know the fear of teachers. He \nspeaks to them as he speaks to everyone. I could have dwelled on his childhood \nand background a little more in the ﬁ  lm to bring this to the fore but I eventually \nfelt that it was not necessary. Rancho lives by his philosophy and his beliefs. He', 'faced the guys who were ragging him. It was Rancho’s attitude and not the scene \nthat was a problem for me. The scene has stayed pretty much the same as it had \nbeen earlier. Rancho’s attitude did not make sense to me. A young boy who comes \ninto the ﬁ rst year should be scared when he faces his seniors. He cannot be this \nguy who comes in and churns out smart lines. He came across as too conﬁ  dent \nand too sure of himself. But as I understood him, he seemed to me a guy who is \nnormal. He does not really know how to face guys who are stronger than him and \nare bullying him. That is the reason he runs away and hides in his room. \nThe tone initially was of one-upmanship and I felt that Rancho should not really \ncare about that. I wanted him to be scared in the ragging scene and do things out \nof fear and not out of knowing how to handle these tough situations. Similarly, \nin the scene where the Director addresses the ﬁ  rst year students and talks to them', '365\nhe feels without thinking of the consequences. And the only way to balance the \noutspokenness of the earlier scene would be to show a degree of fear when he is in \nthe Director’s ofﬁ ce the next morning. He is not taking on the Director or playing \nthis like a challenge. He is making a plea. I am saying a lot of harsh things to the \nDirector and, therefore, I cannot come from a position of arrogance. \nBasically, I played Rancho with a different attitude. He is just being plain honest \nbecause he is innocent enough to be honest. He might be scared but he has to \nsay what he feels because that is who he is. The smart lines, I know, needed to be \nretained but as an actor, I had to say them in a way that made them palatable. \nFarhan and Raju, as characters, were most likely to have the audience behind \nthem because most people would identify either with Farhan or with Raju. \nRancho is a man you admire but not someone who evokes sympathy or empathy. \nWas this a concern for you?']","Rancho faced the guys who were ragging him. Initially, the character was portrayed as too confident, churning out smart lines, and too sure of himself, which the speaker felt was problematic. The revised understanding was that Rancho is a normal guy who does not really know how to face guys who are stronger than him and are bullying him, which is why he ""runs away and hides in his room."" The speaker wanted him to be scared in the ragging scene and do things out of fear.

Inferred about his personality:
The backbone of Rancho's character is his lack of fear, though he can be scared. He is described as a brilliant, free-spirited, and honest boy who is chasing what he is interested in most. He lives by his philosophy and beliefs, and is ""just being plain honest because he is innocent enough to be honest."" He has to say what he feels because that is who he is. Rancho is characterized as a man to be admired, but not someone who evokes sympathy or empathy.","Rancho remains silent and rooted to the spot despite the teasing and humiliation. This suggests that he is a calm and stoic individual who may not react impulsively to provocation. The fact that he holds his hand over his heart and mumbles after being ridiculed implies that he may be a sentimental and emotional person. Overall, Rancho's reaction to ragging reveals his character as a calm and sensitive individual who may be more prone to introspection than outbursts of anger or aggression.",,0.0,1.0,0.887320345200236
How does the use of objects in 3 Idiots affect the emotional depth of the scenes and the dialogue?,"['I am ashamed to admit that for one full year, for the ﬁ  rst ﬁ ve or six drafts of \nthe screenplay, we had something as lame as sleeping pills as the means of Joy’s \ndemise. Peel off a few drafts of the screenplay, and what you stare at is pure \nmediocrity! \nA few  rings, a wheelchair, a laptop, and a letter, these simple objects provided us \nwith the bulwark for the most important beat of the story in 3 Idiots — the twin \nmovement where Raju Rastogi, a changed man after his suicide attempt, fearlessly \nfaces a job interview and Farhan, unyielding but loving, wins his father’s blessings \nfor leaving engineering and embracing photography. Without the aid of objects, \nthe scenes would have needed so many lines of dialogue to convey the complex \nemotions that they would have degenerated into sermons. Objects helped us slash \nthe dialogue and deepen the emotion.', 'a communication gaffe that might soon be sorted out. So he added a few extra \nseconds to our scene: After meeting the stranger, Farhan sees on the wall, a group photo \nof the classmates, featuring all three friends but the place where Rancho sat in the real \nphoto is now occupied by this total stranger. The wrong man. INTERMISSION . The \ninanimate photo provides the scene with the ﬁ  nal turn of the screw. The nebulous \nmystery suddenly becomes concrete. The plot thickens. \nAm I reading too much into this concept of ‘solidiﬁ  cation’ or ‘concretisation’ \nthrough objects? Am I zealously overanalysing a moot point? Are there no major \nscenes in 3 Idiots  that do not rely on objects? Wrong. In fact, the most  famous \nscene of the ﬁ  lm, Chatur’s speech that goes outrageously wrong [ chamatkar versus \nbalatkar, dhan versus sttun] relies entirely on wordplay. So does my favorite scene: \nRancho’s deliberately obscure, whimsical, and wooly-headed deﬁ  nition of books', '339\nwith his father, and Rancho breaking down when they come and tell him \nabout their triumphs. These scenes had several rewrites before they took the \nﬁ nal form in which they are in the ﬁ  lm. Why do you feel that this chunk is \nthe essence of 3 idiots?\nRH: These are the moments in the ﬁ  lm I am most attached to and they make me \nvery emotional. Even while narrating these scenes, I would often get choked with \nemotion. In a way, I feel, they are the crux of the ﬁ  lm. I have always been fond \nof an underdog succeeding. I like hope. I see victory in hope. Be happy, go and \ndo whatever you want without fear. This is what one wants to say about life. We \nhad to put a lot of work into these scenes. For example, a lot of back and forth \nhappened in order to elevate the interview scene to the level we aimed to take it \nto. It was written and rewritten several times. Initially, Raju Rastogi was only saying']","Objects helped to slash the dialogue and deepen the emotion.

How did the narrator's experience at FTII change their perspective on success and what did they learn from this experience?,"['16\nthis time for the editing and not the direction course.
